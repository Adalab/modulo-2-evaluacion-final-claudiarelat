🧑‍💻 **Technologies Used**

🎨 **Aesthetic**

The store is styled with a dark blue theme for a sleek and calming look. Fonts used include:

🚀 **How It Works**

1. Products are fetched from an external API and saved to localStorage on first load.

2. The UI renders all the products and the ones added in the shopping cart.

3. Users can:

* Search for products

* Add/remove them to/from the cart

* Adjust quantities

* Clear the cart entirely

* The cart persists between sessions using localStorage.

📱 **Responsive Design**

* On mobile, the layout stacks vertically for better usability.

* On desktop, a two-column layout separates cart and product grid.

💡 **Future Improvements**

* Add total price calculation

* Enable product filters (category, price, etc.)

* Add animations or transitions for smoother UI

* Add a checkout page and purchase confirmation
