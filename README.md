🧿 **BLUETIQUE** 

Welcome to Bluetique, an online store interface designed to "blue you away" with a clean, modern design and fully interactive features. This project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


🌟 **Features**

🛍️ Product gallery with images, names, and prices

🔎 Product search by title

🛒 Fully functional shopping cart

➕ Add/remove products and adjust quantities

💾 Cart state saved in localStorage

📱 Responsive layout for mobile and tablet


🧑‍💻 **Technologies Used**

* HTML5 & CSS3

* JavaScript 

* Flexbox & CSS Grid for layout

* LocalStorage for persistent cart data

* External API: Adalab Products JSON


🎨 **Aesthetic**

The store features a dark mode design accented with electric blue highlights, creating a modern vibe with high contrast for visual clarity. This slightly neon-inspired palette gives the interface an eye-catching, tech-forward look while maintaining elegance and readability. Fonts used include:

* Quicksand for modern, clean body text

* Playfair Display for elegant headings


🚀 **How It Works**

1. Products are fetched from an external API and saved to localStorage on first load.

2. The UI renders all the products and the ones added in the shopping cart.

3. Users can:

* Search for products

* Add/remove them to/from the cart

* Adjust quantities

* Clear the cart entirely

* The cart persists between sessions using localStorage.


📱 **Responsive Design**

* On mobile, the layout stacks vertically for better usability.

* On desktop, a two-column layout separates cart and product grid.


💡 **Future Improvements**

* Add total price calculation

* Enable product filters (category, price, etc.)

* Add animations or transitions for smoother UI

* Add a checkout page and purchase confirmation
